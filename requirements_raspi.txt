# ============================================
# Raspberry Pi 5 Optimized Requirements
# ============================================
# This file removes ALL PyQt5 dependencies for better performance
# Install with: pip install -r requirements_raspi.txt
#
# KEY CHANGES FROM ORIGINAL:
# ❌ Removed: PyQt5, PyQt5-Qt5, PyQt5-sip, PyQt5-stubs (saves ~400MB)
# ❌ Removed: qt-material, pyqtdarktheme (UI theming not needed)
# ❌ Removed: torchaudio (not used in this project)
# ✅ Changed: opencv-python → opencv-python-headless (lighter, no GUI deps)
# ✅ Kept: Core ML libraries for YOLOv5 inference
#
# EXPECTED INSTALL SIZE: ~400MB (vs ~800MB with PyQt5)
# EXPECTED MEMORY USAGE: ~250-400MB (vs ~600-800MB with PyQt5)
# ============================================

# Core ML/DL frameworks
# Updated to newer versions (2.2.0 no longer available)
torch>=2.0.0
torchvision>=0.15.0
numpy>=1.24.0,<2.0.0

# YOLOv5 object detection
yolov5==7.0.11

# OpenCV - HEADLESS version (NO Qt/GUI dependencies!)
# This is the key optimization - much lighter than opencv-python
opencv-python-headless==4.8.1.78

# HuggingFace hub for model downloads
huggingface-hub==0.24.7

# OPTIONAL: System monitoring (can be removed to save 2MB)
